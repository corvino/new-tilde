# Tilde Version Control Starter Kit

A slimmed down version of [corvino/tilde](https://github.com/corvino/tilde) that uses symlinks to a version-controlled directory for *nix user configuration files. This provides a light-foot-print starting place for users new to these files or to putting them under version control.

# Getting started

Put this where you like (`~/.tilde` is a fine choice) and then run setup.sh from the home (`~`) directory to create the necessary symlinks.

The .bashrc file setups up the prompt and some homebrew and scripting-language stuff.

The .gitconfig sets up the exclude file and turns on colors; don't forget to add name and email.
